Console.WriteLine() prints a message to the output console.
At the end of the line, it adds a line feed similar to pressing Enter or Return to create a new line.

To print to the output console, but without adding a line feed at the end, you use the second technique, Console.Write().
 So, the next call to Console.Write() prints another message to the same line.

/*
The Console part is called a class. Classes "own" methods; or you could say that methods live inside of a class.
There's also a dot (or period) that separates the class name Console and the method name WriteLine().
The period is the member access operator. In other words, the dot is how you "navigate" from the class to one of its methods.

The WriteLine() part is called a method. You can always spot a method because it has a set of parentheses after it
